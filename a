Recycling helps conserve natural resources, reduces pollution, saves energy, and minimizes landfill waste. By recycling materials like paper, plastic, glass, and metal, we can reduce the need for raw material extraction, which often leads to habitat destruction and environmental degradation. Additionally, recycling reduces greenhouse gas emissions associated with manufacturing processes, contributing to the fight against climate change.
